## How To Use

Highlight Worlds by clicking on them and then click on items to mark them as collected in that world. Clicking on a marked item will return it to the item pool.

The question marks connected to each world can be increased/decreased with the scroll wheel and are used to keep track of a worlds reported hint value. alternatively page up/page down can be used to modify the currently selected worlds hint value.
