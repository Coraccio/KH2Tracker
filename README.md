## How To Use

Drag an item to the location that you found it in. Alternatively highlight worlds by clicking on them and then double click on items to mark them as collected in that world. Clicking on a marked item will return it to the item pool.

The question marks connected to each world can be increased/decreased with the scroll wheel and are used to keep track of a worlds reported important check count. alternatively page up/page down can be used to modify the currently selected worlds important check count.

If a hint file is loaded into the tracker reports must be tracked correctly. Incorrectly tracking a report 3 times will lock you out of tracking that report and receiving its hint. When a report is tracked properly the hint message will display and the corresponding worlds important check count will update. Hovering over already tracked reports will also display their hint text.
